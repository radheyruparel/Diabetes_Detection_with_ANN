# Diabetes Detection with Artificial Neural Network

Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

The dataset consists of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Diabetes is considered a long-term condition that tends to occur if it fails to produce insulin. Blood sugar levels (high or low) can have a negative impact on a variety of organs, including the eyes, neurons, and blood vessels, among others. Patients with diabetes must have their health regularly monitored to prevent their health from deteriorating.

By 1970, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was about forty percent among Pimas age thirty-five and older, and currently affects about half of all Pimas over age thirty-five. 

In this project, I build an artificial neural network-based model to predict accurately diabetes in patients. Hence such ML-based models might help individuals in the PIMA community make a more precise detection for diabetes, so they can seek required medical interventions.
