# Diabetes Detection with Artificial Neural Network

Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

The dataset consist of Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Patients with diabetes who are closely monitored have a higher overall quality of life than those who are not. Costs associated with healthcare can be decreased by utilising the Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to technological advancements. To satisfy the expectations of e-health applications, it is required for the development of the intelligent systems as well as increases the number of applications that are connected to the network. As a result, in order to achieve these goals, the cellular network should be capable of supporting intelligent healthcare applications that require high energy efficiency. In this paper, we model a neural network-based ensemble voting classifier to predict accurately the diabetes in the patients via online monitoring. The study consists of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor the instances of the patients. While monitoring, the data are transferred from IoT devices to smartphones and then to the cloud, where the process of classification takes place. The simulation is conducted on the collected samples using the python tool. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy rate, higher precision, recall, and f-measure than existing state-of-art ensemble models.
